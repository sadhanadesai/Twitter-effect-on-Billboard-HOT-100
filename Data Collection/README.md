This project has Twitter and Billboard as the platform from which data has been collected. Below two sections specify the details of data collection from the two sources:

1. Twitter : Data is collected using Twitter Streaming API to collect real time tweets.The resource URL used is https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/sample/stream

2. Billboard : There is no official API for Billboard, so we have created a script just to get HOT-100 chart entries
